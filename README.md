# Fightcade Keyboard Navigation

```
/Applications/FightCade2.app/Contents/MacOS/Fightcade2  --remote-debugging-port=8315
```

Then I downloaded all the pages manually, so that I can play with them
Also added an import to `custom.js`, ideally we would use https://github.com/tapio/live-server/issues/338 instead
